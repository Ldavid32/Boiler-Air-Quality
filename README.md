# Boiler-Air-Quality
Boiler Air emissions data display Nitrous Oxide (NOx) Particulate Matter (PM2.5), and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) per km2 in New York City for year 2013.
This data has been cleaned. This data was retreived from the City of New York Health Department for year 2013. This project is still a work in progress. A boxplot will be used to 
display the relationship between SO2, PM2.5, and NOx in a km2 area per Neighorhood(NB). All values(V) are in ug/m3.
